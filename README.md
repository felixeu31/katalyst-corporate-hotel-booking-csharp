## Kata guidelines
- Outside-In TDD should be used.
- Starting from acceptance tests, one at a time.
- Define your acceptance tests as small vertical slices, involving at least two services.
- Once a failing acceptance test is compiling and failing for the right reasons (services are not implemented), start unit testing the services, one public method at a time.
